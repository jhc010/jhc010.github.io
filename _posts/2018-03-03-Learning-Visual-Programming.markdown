Just posting some snippets from my past assignments for a Visual Programming class
that I thought were interesting.

[Foreground and background][fgbg]

![ss1](/images/fgbg.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Output when fbgb is run with no args or just coins_pix.jpg.

[Fixing alignment][FixAlign]

![ss2](/images/FixAlign1.png){:class="img-responsive"}

![ss3](/images/FixAlign2.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Output when FixAlign is run with no args or just pen.jpg.

[FixAlign]:   https://github.com/jhc010/Python-Programs/blob/master/FixAlign.py
