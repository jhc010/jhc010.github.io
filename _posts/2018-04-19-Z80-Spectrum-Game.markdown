This was a large project which was the culmination of my CSE190 demo programming
under hardware constraints class with Hovav Shacham at UCSD. This project was done
in a group of three and I was in charge of the sprites and animations for the game.

The game was written in Z80 assembly and constrained by hardware limits, making optimization
a crucial aspect of the project.
